# Conversation: Update First Two Articles from CSV

**Cascade:** Okay, I can help with that. I'll start by reading the `recent_clicks.csv` file to identify the first two articles. Then, I'll extract their slugs and use the `mcp3_update-article` tool to update them.
*Tool Call: `view_file` with arguments: `{"AbsolutePath":"/home/jp/supai/mcp-workspace/recent_clicks.csv","StartLine":0,"EndLine":2,"IncludeSummaryOfOtherLines":false}`*

**Tool Response (`view_file`):**
```
0: page,clicks,impressions,ctr,position
1: https://sup.ai/articles/health/trodusquemine-availability-and-approval-timeline,14,172,0.08139534883720931,5.633720930232558
2: https://sup.ai/articles/health/should-i-drink-liquid-iv-before-or-after-alcohol-consumption,7,271,0.025830258302583026,10.59409594095941
```

**Cascade:** Okay, I have the URLs for the first two articles.
The first article is `https://sup.ai/articles/health/trodusquemine-availability-and-approval-timeline` and its slug is `trodusquemine-availability-and-approval-timeline`.
The second article is `https://sup.ai/articles/health/should-i-drink-liquid-iv-before-or-after-alcohol-consumption` and its slug is `should-i-drink-liquid-iv-before-or-after-alcohol-consumption`.

I will now update these two articles.
